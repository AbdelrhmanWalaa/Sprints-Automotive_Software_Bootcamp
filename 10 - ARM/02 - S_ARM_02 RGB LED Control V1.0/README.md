# RGB LED Control V1.0

## Description

The RGB LED Control project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of the Tiva C TM4C123GXL LaunchPad board by implementing 
a simple user interface using the SW1 button. The project enables users to control the color and behavior of an RGB LED 
by pressing the SW1 button on the board. By combining the power of the Tiva C microcontroller and the versatility of the 
RGB LED, this project offers an interactive and visually engaging experience.

## Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- TivaC board.
- SW1 as an input button.
- RGB LED.

### Software Requirements

- The RGB LED should be OFF initially.
- Pressing SW1 should have the following behavior:

  1. After the first press, the Red LED is on.
  2. After the second press, the Green LED is on.
  3. After the third press, the Blue LED is on.
  4. After the fourth press, all LEDs are on.
  5. After the fifth press, all LEDs should be disabled.
  6. After the sixth press, the cycle should repeat from step 1 to step 6.
