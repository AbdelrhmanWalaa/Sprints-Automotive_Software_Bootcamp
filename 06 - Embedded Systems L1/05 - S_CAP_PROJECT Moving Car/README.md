## Overview

The Moving Car project involves the development of a robot using four motors, two buttons, and four LEDs. The robot follows a continuous rectangular path, showcasing precise movement control and an efficient control system design. This project serves as a testament to programming proficiency in managing a robot's movements and crafting an effective control mechanism.

## Project Goals

- Develop a robot capable of controlled movement using four motors.
- Create a functional control system that responds to button inputs.
- Design a sequential movement pattern following a rectangular path.
- Demonstrate programming skills in managing the robot's speed and direction changes.
- Implement efficient rotations and stops at specific points within the movement pattern.

## Expected Outcomes

- Successful creation of a functional robot that adheres to the specified movement pattern.
- Demonstration of precise movements and rotations, showcasing effective motor control.
- Understanding of event-based programming through the interaction between buttons and robot behavior.
- Enhanced programming skills in managing timing, speed, and rotations for accurate movement.
- Achievement of a reliable and repeatable rectangular path traversal, meeting project requirements.
- Highlighted prioritization of the stop button (PB2) as an emergency brake mechanism.
