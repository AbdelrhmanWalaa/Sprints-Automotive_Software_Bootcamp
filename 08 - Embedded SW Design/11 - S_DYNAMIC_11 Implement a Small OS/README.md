## Overview

This project involves the development of software for a car robot capable of avoiding objects in front of it. The robot will utilize an ATmega32 microcontroller along with various hardware components, such as four motors, a button to change the default direction of rotation, a keypad for start/stop commands, an ultrasonic sensor for object detection, and an LCD for displaying relevant information.

## Project Goals

- Develop a software system that allows the car robot to navigate safely, avoiding obstacles in its path.
- Implement a user-friendly control mechanism using the keypad buttons to start and stop the robot.
- Provide an interface through the LCD to set the default direction of rotation (right or left) before the robot starts moving.
- Design the robot to move forward at various speeds based on obstacle proximity, ensuring smooth operation in different scenarios.
- Enable the robot to respond appropriately to detected objects at different distances, adjusting its speed and performing rotations or reversals when necessary.

## Expected Outcomes

- A fully functional car robot capable of autonomously avoiding obstacles in its path.
- A user-friendly interface using the LCD for displaying relevant information and setting the default rotation direction.
- Smooth and efficient movement of the robot at varying speeds, ensuring safe object avoidance.
- The ability of the robot to respond accurately to objects at different distances, including stopping, rotating, and reversing as needed.
- A comprehensive hardware-software integration, showcasing the successful collaboration of the ATmega32 microcontroller with the motors, ultrasonic sensor, buttons, and LCD.
