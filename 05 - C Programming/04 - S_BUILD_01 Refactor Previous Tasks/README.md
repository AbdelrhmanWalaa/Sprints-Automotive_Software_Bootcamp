# Refactor Previous Tasks

## Description

Use what you have learned from the build process and refactor your previous tasks to become multi-file projects.
Multi-file Applications are your first step for clean coding.

## Requirements

1. Refactor the Check Balanced Algorithm
    - Refactor according to the following
      1. Group functions related to each other in one .c file
          - All Stack functions must be in stack.c file
          - All Balanced Paranthethes functions must be in balanced.c file
      2. Create a header file for each .c file containing all types and macros used
          - Create a stack.h file
          - Create a balanced.h file
      3. Create main.c and main.h files
          - Refactor the main algorithm to work successfully
      4. Convert all magic numbers into macros
      5. Rename all variables that have unuseful names and give them appropriate names according to their role

2. Refactor the LCS Algorithm
    - Refactor according to the following
      1. Group functions related to each other in one .c file
          - All sorting functions must be in sort.c file
          - All LCS functions must be in lcs.c file
      2. Create a header file for each .c file containing all types and macros used
          - Create a sort.h file
          - Create a lcs.h file
      3. Create main.c and main.h files
          - Refactor the main algorithm to work successfully
      4. Convert all magic numbers into macros
      5. Rename all variables that have unuseful names and give them appropriate names according to their role
