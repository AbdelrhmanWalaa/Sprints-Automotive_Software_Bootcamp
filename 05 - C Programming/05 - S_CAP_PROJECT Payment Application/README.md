## Overview

Welcome to the Payment Application project! In this project, we have created a simulated environment that emulates a payment system for conducting SALE transactions. The system includes the interaction between a virtual card, terminal (ATM), and server to facilitate seamless SALE transactions.

Payment systems have become an integral part of our daily lives, and this project aims to provide a hands-on experience with the functionalities and processes involved in a virtual banking system. The focus of this project is on the SALE transaction, which allows users to make purchases and have the corresponding amount deducted from their bank accounts.

## Project Goals

- Simulate SALE Transaction: The primary goal of the Payment Application project is to create a Payment Application that enables users to simulate a SALE transaction. This emulation mirrors the process of making a purchase and deducting the corresponding amount from the user's bank account. Through this simulation, users can understand the fundamental steps involved in a transaction within a banking context.

## Expected Outcomes

- Comprehensive Payment System Understanding: The Payment Application project's expected outcome is that users will acquire an in-depth comprehension of payment systems, their intricacies, and the interplay between various transaction types. This understanding extends beyond the simple SALE transaction, encompassing a broader perspective on how different transactions contribute to a robust and versatile payment ecosystem.

- Practical Insights through Hands-on Learning: By engaging actively in the implementation of the SALE transaction and exploring interactions among virtual card, terminal, and server components, users will gain hands-on experience. This practical engagement allows them to grasp the communication flow and mechanisms underlying a payment system, empowering them with real-world insights into the domain of financial technology.
